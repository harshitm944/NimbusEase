# NimbusEase: Secure Blockchain-Backed Cloud Storage with AI Monitoring

NimbusEase is a futuristic, highly secure cloud storage platform that integrates **Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain** for data integrity and **TensorFlow-powered AI** for real-time threat detection and automated mitigation.

## 🛡️ Security & Privacy Architecture

NimbusEase is built on a "Security-First" philosophy, employing multiple layers of defense to protect user data and system integrity.

### 1. AI-Driven Threat Detection & Autonomous Response
The system features a global `AiSecurityGuard` that analyzes every request in real-time.
*   **TensorFlow Anomaly Detection:** Uses a trained neural network to identify suspicious access patterns based on entropy, resource usage, and action frequency.
*   **LLM Threat Analysis:** High-risk activities are analyzed by a specialized security LLM (via LM Studio) to classify attacks like Brute Force, SQLi, SSRF, and Prompt Injection.
*   **Autonomous Mitigation:** The system can automatically execute defensive actions, including:
    *   **BLOCK_IP:** Blacklisting malicious source IPs.
    *   **REVOKE_USER:** Terminating active sessions for compromised accounts.
    *   **FREEZE_STORAGE:** Suspends write operations if Ransomware behavior is detected.
    *   **WORKLOAD_MIGRATION:** Moves services between isolated hosts if side-channel attacks are detected.
*   **Injection Protection:** All data sent to the AI engine is sanitized to prevent **Prompt Injection** attacks.

### 2. Blockchain-Backed Data Integrity
Every file uploaded to NimbusEase is registered on a **Hyperledger Fabric** private blockchain.
*   **Immutable Hashing:** A SHA-256 hash of each file is stored on-chain.
*   **Integrity Verification:** During every download, the system re-calculates the file hash and compares it against the blockchain record. If a mismatch is detected (indicating tampering), access is blocked and a security alert is raised.
*   **Audit Trail:** All file operations (Upload, Download, Delete) are logged on the blockchain, providing a permanent, tamper-proof history.

### 3. Advanced Encryption & Storage
*   **AES-256-GCM Encryption:** Files are encrypted client-side or server-side (depending on configuration) using industry-standard AES-256-GCM.
*   **Secure Key Management:** Encryption keys are never stored in plain text and are hashed using SHA-256 for verification.
*   **Path Traversal Prevention:** Strict path validation ensures users cannot access files outside of their authorized directory.

### 4. Hardened Authentication & Identity
*   **Secure JWT Management:** Uses dual-token (Access + Refresh) authentication with **HttpOnly, Secure, and SameSite: Strict** cookies to prevent XSS and CSRF attacks.
*   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Supports TOTP-based MFA (Google Authenticator) for an additional layer of account security.
*   **Privacy-Aware Logging:** Personally Identifiable Information (PII) like email addresses are masked in audit logs to comply with privacy regulations.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Granular permissions enforced across the entire API.
